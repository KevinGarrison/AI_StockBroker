                        1. Technical Analysis:
                        - Analyze moving averages (e.g., 20-day vs 50-day SMA).

                        2. Fundamental Analysis:
                        - Evaluate key metrics such as P/E ratio, ROE, and EPS.

                        - Consider the provided sentiment summary (from news, social media, etc.).
